# An AI-Based Medical Chatbot Model for Infectious Disease Prediction

This project aims to demonstrate how chatbots can be effectively used in the medical sector to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. By raising awareness among users, we can provide them with accurate medical solutions to help them stay healthy. We developed a preliminary training model and conducted a study to improve human interaction with databases in 2021. Through natural language processing, we analyzed human behavior and characteristics in chatbots. Our proposed AI Chatbot interaction and prediction model utilizes a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron. We discovered a lack of theoretical guidelines and practical recommendations for creating AI chatbots for lifestyle improvement programs. In this paper, we provide a brief comparison of our proposed model's time complexity and testing accuracy. Our study achieved a minimum loss of 0.1232 and a highest accuracy of 94.32%. We discuss the functionalities and possible applications of medical chatbots and the challenges that come with using these emerging technologies during health crises, especially pandemics. We hope that our findings will provide researchers with a better understanding of medical chatbot functionality and help improve their applications. This will be crucial in preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19.
